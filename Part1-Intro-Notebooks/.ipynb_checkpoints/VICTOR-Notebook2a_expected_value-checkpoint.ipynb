    "1. The integral of a probability density function is equal to 1 (unity). The probability density function varies over some range, integrating over that range yields the value 1. In other words, there is a 100 percent chance of the value being drawn from the entire range. For example, here is a PDF:\n",

Be sure to find the expected value of your index and estimate the probability of particularly large events, given your data.
