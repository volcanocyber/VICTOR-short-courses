    "\n",
    "Volcano hazard modeling often involves map data. We want to know where the volcano is, where the town is, and what the path is of a potential debris flow from the volcano to the town. Unfortunately, we are faced with a bewildering array of map coordinate systems. These coordinate systems may be latitude / longitude, UTM, or more local coordinate systems like the New Zealand grid. How do we develop a common coordinate system for our hazard projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "An oblate spheroid of revolution that gives the shape of the Earth is described by\n",
    "an equation with parameters like eccentricity (flattening), the Earthâ€™s radius and location of the exact center of the Earth. Different map datums refer to different parameters used in this equation. WGS84 is a datum now in wide use. Nevertheless, a large number of maps in print and derivative electronic files from older studies were constructed using the Clarke 1866 and NAD27 datums in North America, or some similar, local datum in other parts of the world. These datums exist because the exact equation parameters were poorly known in the past, so scientists used the best parameters that seemed to fit the geodetic data in their region. \n",
    "\n",
    "As different datums are in use, it is crucial to understand that a given location at the surface of the Earth will have different coordinates depending on the datum used. That is, a given point will have different latitude and longitude, or different UTM coordinate, depending on the map datum. Transformation from one datum to another is a complex calculation, involving many precisely determined constants. In volcanic hazard assessment, we are often faced with the problem that we have data in one projection and coordinate system and we need to input the data into the model using a different datum or different coordinate system. For example, we might know the latitutde and longitude of the volcanic crater using the WGS84 map datum and we wish to input those coordinates into a numerical model for tephra dispersion using a WGS84 datum and UTM coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an example of map coordinate transformation using Proj, the widely used code developed by Staff at the USGS. More information about Proj is available at https://proj.org/. This notebook uses pyproj, a version with a python wrapper to make it easier to call from your notebook. Proj is designed to run on the command line in UNIX systems like Linux, but has been adapted to python as the pyproj library. Proj is widely embedded in GIS software, like QGIS.\n",
